To run the app, either open the main file and run it, or open the SpectrumAnalyserApp.mlapp and run it

Tabs:
1) Any Signal
  
   This tab takes a signal as input and does spectrum analysis on it.
   a. In this tab, click on the 'Signal Equation' input field and type the signal in the format accepted by matlab.
       Use t to denote time
       For example 2*sin(2*pi*t)+3*sin(2*pi*3*t)
   b. enter the upper limit of time, upto which you want to view the signal
        For example, 10
   c. Click on the Analyse button 
   d. The time domain and frequency domain Graphs of the signal is plotted and 'Success!!' is printed in Result field
				or
       'Error!!' is printed in Result field in case of error
2)Audio Signals Tab
   
   This tab does spectrum analysis on a sound file
    a. To add an audio file, either copy that file in the app folder and type its name as filename, or type the URL of the file
        residing on your system as URL
        To avoid complexity, some audio files are already been added in the folder which can be choosen by using a dropdown 
        box
    b. To hear the audio clip, click on play sound
    c. Click on Analyse button to do spectrum analysis upon the audio file
    d. The time domain and frequency domain Graphs of the audio signal is plotted and 'Success!!' is printed in Result field
				or
       'Cannot find audio file' is printed in Result field if it fails to find the audio file
